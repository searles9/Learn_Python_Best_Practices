# Whitespaces Best Practices in Expressions and Statements
***
***
# whitespaces and variables
* variables cant have spaces
* when you use operators they should have a space on both sides (just 1 space)... ```if 1 > 3:```
* good ... ```first_name = "Donovan"```
***
***
# whitespaces and parentheses
* avoid extraneous whitespace immediately inside parentheses, brackets of breaces
* dont do this: ```foo( 1, 2 )```
* do this: ```foo(1, 2)```
* dont do this (the space after foo)... ```foo (1, 2)```
* dont do this (the spaces before and after the first and last number): ``` numbers = ( 1, 2,3 ) ```
* dont do this with trailing commas (the space)... ```foo = (0, )```
***
***
# whitespaces, commas, colons, semi colons
* avoid extra whitespace before a comma or colon
* dont do this (the space): ```if <condition> :```
* dont do this (the spaces): ```(1 , 2 , 3 , 4)```
***
***
# whitespaces and operators
* these binary operators should always have a single space on both sides...
``` = += -= //= *= /= %= **=```
* these comparison operators should always have a single space on boths sides... ```< > == <= >= !=```
* bad.... ```score+=1```
* good ... ```score += 1```
* theese should also have a space on each side... ```in , not in, is , is not```
* logical operators should also have a space on both sides... ``` and, or , not```
* bad: ```i=i+1```
* good: ```i = i + 1```
* good: ```a*a + b*b```
